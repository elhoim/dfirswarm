"""Runs inside the image build. Installs what spec.json names and records
what the image ended up holding.

  install.py SPEC          a profile image: install what the spec names, then record
  install.py --base        the base image: record only (base.Dockerfile installs)
  install.py --build FILE  a builder stage: compile one program from its pinned
                           source under /opt/dfir/tools/<name>, which the
                           profile's stage copies (recipe.py writes both)

A package a pack marks required stops the build if it cannot be installed,
and so does a required program that is not on PATH afterwards. An optional
one that fails is recorded and the install goes on, but at the end every
program the packs name must be on PATH unless it was left out on purpose (a
download with no build for this architecture, a source or a build pinned for
other architectures, a program no line installs): a program that should be
here and is not stops the build, so nothing is tagged. A full disk once made
apt fail for optional programs and the image came out without them, saying so
only in its record. `recipe.py build --allow-missing-optional` lets such an
image be built, and it records what it lacks. The record,
/etc/dfirswarm/image.json, is what a run
cites for "which tools, at which versions, examined this"; /etc/dfirswarm/
NOTICE says whose each program is and under which licence; /etc/dfirswarm/
sbom.json lists every package the image holds (Debian, Python, npm, pinned
downloads with their sha256) as a CycloneDX document.

Every image, the base included, records its whole Debian package list
(`dpkg_all`) and its venv (`pip`): what a VM holds at stop is compared with
them (scripts/vm.ts INVENTORY_SCRIPT), so an install outside the image is
named and the image's own packages are not.

A pinned data file (`install.data`: a program's tables or rules, which the
program reads and which are not a program) is fetched and checked the same
way and put, as named, where the program looks for it: inside a Python package
of the image's venv (`package`, `into`). Its pack may name a command to run
once it is there (`warm`), for a program that indexes what it finds on first
use and would otherwise do it in every VM the image boots, and a command that
must succeed afterwards (`check`; the images workflow runs it again with no
network). A data file that cannot be had fails the build even when its program
is optional: the pack pinned it on purpose, and an image without it would say
the program is there while what it reads is not. `recipe.py build
--allow-missing-data` goes on without it, and the image then records it under
`not_installed.data`; one its build left out on purpose (`--symbol-set`) is
under `omitted.data`. An entry with `commands` is a source converted in the
build (fetch_data): the outputs are hashed, compared by content where pinned
(json-canon/1, canonical_sha256), and recorded apart from the source. An entry
the operator acquires is never downloaded here, and needs the operator's
recorded acceptance of its terms.

Every download is bounded: HTTPS on every redirect hop (at most five), no more
bytes than pinned (`bytes`, else DFIRSWARM_FETCH_MAX_BYTES), within
DFIRSWARM_FETCH_SECONDS in all. A local copy by sha256 in DFIRSWARM_DATA_DIR
(recipe.py build --data-from, --symbols-from) is used, still checked, instead
of the network.

A pinned download is fetched over HTTPS, checked against its sha256 before
anything is unpacked, unpacked under /opt/dfir/tools/<name>/ and put on PATH
by a wrapper in /usr/local/bin. An architecture with no entry is recorded,
not guessed. A `.deb` is installed by apt from where it was checked, so its
dependencies come from Debian. A pinned source is checked the same way,
unpacked under /opt/dfir/src/<name>/ (its archive's one top directory
dropped), given a venv of its own there when it names Python requirements —
one program's pins never move another's — and its entry is put on PATH the
same way, through its interpreter. A program built from source is checked,
configured with its prefix under /opt/dfir/tools, made and installed in a
builder stage; a failure there is recorded beside what it left and fails
the stage (a stage that ends well is cached, and a cached failure would be
every later build's), unless the program is not for this architecture or the
build allows optional programs to be missing. A source with no
configure script names its steps (`commands`, each an argument list run in the
unpacked tree, `{prefix}` and `{jobs}` filled in) and the pinned patches to
apply first (`patches`, each a url and a sha256, applied with `patch -p1`).
Every pinned artefact is in image.json (`downloads`, with its kind), the
NOTICE and the SBOM.
