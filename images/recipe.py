"""Turn packs into image recipes, and say which image a run needs.

  recipe.py build PROFILE --out DIR [--base IMAGE] [--packs DIR] [--allow-nonredistributable] [--allow-missing-data]
                 [--symbol-set curated,broad|curated|broad|none] [--data-from DIR]... [--symbols-from DIR]...
  recipe.py profile-for [--installed DIR]... [--tools-from DIR]... PACK...
                                       the smallest profile that serves these packs
  recipe.py list                       profiles and the packs each resolves to
  recipe.py check-lock FILE            refuse a lock entry not pinned by digest

A profile is a named set of packs (images/profiles.json), with every pack's
dependencies added, so an image never lacks the base its method builds on.
For each pack, `requires/host.json` says which binaries its method calls and
how to install them, and `requires/python.txt` lists the libraries its tools
import. The packs are the single source: a microVM run's probe checks the
image against them (scripts/vm.ts imageFit), and this turns the same lines
into an image. On the host the agents install what they lack themselves.

`profile-for` finds each pack where a run finds it: a PACK given as a path is
that directory; a name is looked up in each --installed DIR (default
$DFIRSWARM_HOME/packs, where scripts/pack.sh installs, ~/.dfirswarm/packs
without it), then in --packs-dir (this repository's packs/). An installed
pack the repository does not carry, a pro or third-party one, is then matched
by what it names, like any other. --tools-from names a tool directory whose
manifests say which programs they call (`requires`): those move the choice to
a bigger image only when one smaller than `full` has them all.

`check-lock` reads an images lock (`{"images": {PROFILE: {ARCH: REF}}}`, what
SWARM_IMAGES_LOCK names) and refuses an entry that is not `name@sha256:` and
64 hex digits: a tag can be moved under a run, a digest cannot.

`build` writes DIR/spec.json (what to install, and what cannot be installed
from a package manager), DIR/NOTICE (every program, its pack, its licence and
where it comes from) and DIR/Dockerfile, and copies install.py beside them,
so DIR is a complete build context:

  docker build -t dfirswarm-re:dev-amd64 DIR

A program or a data file a pack marks `redistributable: false` stops the build
unless `--allow-nonredistributable` is given: an image that stays on this
machine or in a private registry, never one published for others to pull, and
one that carries pinned data (`install.data`) is pushed by no workflow of ours,
the pro edition's included. The image then says so (image.json, its label, its
NOTICE).

A program no package manager has may carry a pinned artefact in its pack,
each fetched by install.py and refused unless its sha256 is the pinned one:

  install.download   a version, and per architecture a URL, its sha256 and the
                     program's path inside the archive. A `.deb` is installed
                     by apt, so its dependencies come from Debian; its `bin`,
                     when it has one, is where the package puts the program.
                     An architecture with no entry is recorded as not installed.
  install.source     one archive for every architecture (a tag's tarball),
                     unpacked under /opt/dfir/src/<name>, its `pip` arguments
                     run in a venv of its own there, its `entry` put on PATH.
  install.build      a source archive compiled in a builder stage of the
                     image (`./configure --prefix`, `make`, `make install`),
                     so the image carries the program and not the compiler.
                     A source with no configure script names its steps
                     (`commands`, argument lists run in the tree) and the
                     pinned `patches` applied first. `env` is the environment
                     of a source's pip, or of a build's configure and make;
                     `arches`, the architectures a source or a build is for
                     (every one when absent).
  install.data       one file a program reads and that is not a program (a
                     symbol table pack, a rule set), the same bytes for every
                     architecture: a url and its sha256, put as named inside
                     a Python package of the image's venv (`package`, `into`).
                     `warm` is a command run once it is there, for a program
                     that indexes what it finds the first time it runs;
                     `check` one that must then succeed (the images workflow
                     runs it again with no network). The entry says whether
                     it is `redistributable` and carries its own `licence`,
                     which the NOTICE states beside the program's. A data
                     file that cannot be had fails the build even for an
                     optional program (`build --allow-missing-data` goes on
                     without it, and the image records what is missing).
                     It may be a list, or {"list": FILE}: a template and
                     entries in a file of the pack, expanded entry by entry.
                     `set` (curated, broad) is what --symbol-set selects; a
                     set left out is recorded as omitted. `commands` and
                     `outputs` convert a source in the build, each output's
                     content pinned (`canonical`, `canonical_sha256`) for one
                     `converter` version; `acquire: "operator"` is never
                     fetched by the build, only taken from the operator's
                     store (--symbols-from) with the recorded acceptance of
                     its terms, and the build stops before Docker without it.
                     Local copies (--data-from, $DFIRSWARM_DATA_DIR) are bound
                     into the install step, never copied into a layer.

Every program the packs name must be in the image when its build ends,
optional or not, unless it is left out on purpose (a download with no build
for this architecture, a source or a build pinned for others with `arches`, a
program no line installs): an optional one that could not be installed stops
the build, so a build that went wrong (apt out of disk space) is not tagged,
and a builder stage that failed is not cached as a success. `build
--allow-missing-optional` builds the image without such programs and records
them; its spec.json and every builder stage it lets fail carry a build id of
their own. Regenerating the context changes that id and reruns the install
and those stages; reusing an existing context needs `docker build --no-cache`
to avoid taking an earlier build's gaps from the cache.

`run` names the interpreter a download's or a source's program needs:
`python` (the program's own venv, else the image's), or any program the image
holds (`perl`, `dotnet`, which a pack may pin as a download of its own). An apt
line with `-t <codename>-backports` comes from the image's Debian backports.

A program marked `not_in_image` (with why) belongs to another system than the
analysis image — Apple's `log`, a collector run on the source host — and is
listed as not applicable, not as missing. Anything else no line above installs
is listed under `manual` and never installed.
