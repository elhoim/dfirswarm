/**
 * The store sweep (docs/adr/0013, "After the round-13 scoring"): a negative
 * is checked against everything the run already holds, not only against the
 * sources its coverage record names.
 *
 * On the round-13 scoring runs, five answers were written not determinable
 * while the row that answered two of them sat in a parser export the run
 * itself had made half an hour before; each passed a review, because the
 * reviews checked the answer against its coverage record's two or three
 * sources, never against the store. A coverage record now names what a hit
 * would contain (`looked_for`: literal strings), and the hub searches every
 * output the run holds for them when the record is written: every sealed
 * job output and job log, every import (evidence added late included: an
 * import is an output the run holds), every capture, every whole output the
 * harness kept under tool-output/. Not the input images: the coverage record
 * is where they are searched. Bytes and strings only, case-insensitive for
 * ASCII, in UTF-8 and in UTF-16LE, every file streamed whole: no format
 * parser and no per-tool code (the harness stays tool-agnostic). A budget of
 * bytes and time bounds a sweep; what it did not reach is named, and the
 * sweep is partial, never clean.
 *
 * The record is immutable and the sweep is not instant, so the result is a
 * line of its own in ledger/sweeps.jsonl, chained like the attestations and
 * bound to the coverage record by its hash. A record with looked_for and no
 * sweep line is pending. The gate (protocol.ts ledgerGate) reads them.
 *
 * The same bytes under several names are one object: a file the harness
 * kept under tool-output/ and the import it was sealed as are one, so a
 * record that names either names both (the run sd0e59d held three
 * negatives on kept outputs whose sealed imports their records named).
 *
 * The rules change, and a recorded line keeps what it was written under
 * (docs/adr/0013, "Re-reading after a rules change"): each line names the
 * version of the sweep's rules it was written by (`rules`; a line with none
 * is older than any versioned one). When the hub starts, and at the answers
 * check and the finish gate, a record whose latest line is older than this
 * harness's rules is read again under them (rereadSweeps): its hits sorted
 * anew from what the line recorded, nothing searched, or, where a change
 * needs bytes the line did not record, its record searched again within
 * the sweep's budget. The result is a line of its own on the chain
 * (`reread`), the trace gets a line and the board one post.
 *
 * Echoes (docs/adr/0013, "Echoes: authored, not derived"): a hit in an
 * object whose every name was made by a command or a job that read nothing
 * of the run but its own registers (the ledger, the board, SWARM.md, the
 * trace…) and named objects this sweep found the same string in, and whose
 * own words name the string or that read registers alone, or kept by the
 * harness from a seat's own model words outside any tool call (a
 * compaction summary), holds the string by construction: it is the run's
 * words, or a named hit's again, not new evidence. It is named on the line
 * (`echoes`, with what made each name) and holds nothing. One whose maker
 * read such named objects, and whose words do not name the string, is said
 * among the named hits, with what it read. A maker that read anything else
 * (an input, which the sweep never reads, included), or whose reads cannot
 * be told (a command that names no path, a job that saw everything),
 * leaves the hit standing. The makers come from the trace (the line that
 * kept the file) and the jobs' own records: refs and words only, no parser.
 *
 * The reverse sweep (docs/adr/0013, "Late evidence: the reverse sweep and
 * the delta"): when evidence is added, the new import's files, and only
 * they, are searched for the looked_for strings of every coverage record
 * standing then, and each hit is bound to the records whose strings it
 * holds. Its lines (version 2, `of: "import"`) are on the same chain, bound
 * to the addition's external entry by its hash. It runs after the
 * addition commits, never inside it: in the background of the hub's round,
 * or as a detached step when no hub runs, a pass at a time within a budget
 * of its own (reverseSweepBudget); what a pass leaves (`left`) is named on
 * its line and searched by the next pass, at the next round, until nothing
 * is left (the Fable review of the limits branch, P2-4). Each pass's hits
 * are delivered on the board when it completes, and to the re-examination
 * of the questions those records name (the stale answer's words, a
 * warning); they hold nothing by themselves.
