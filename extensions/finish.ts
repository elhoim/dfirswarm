/**
 * The finish: one coordinator, one check result per revision, readiness
 * shown to everyone, and typed acts around the report (docs/adr/0015).
 *
 * On ctf12 every seat called `done` when the last attest landed: Belka had
 * nine calls by six seats in 58 s and three sentinels in one second, c09 all
 * eight seats in 61 s, and the tail from every question answered to the
 * sentinel ran 33 to 64 minutes. Three things fed it, each verified in the
 * code: the late-posts rule fired once per seat and asked each to explain
 * itself on the board, which made the next seat's late post; historical
 * limiting closes blocked after their questions were answered; and the
 * prompt told every seat to call done. Here:
 *
 * - One coordinator holds the finish, by a lease with a generation in
 *   `leads/finish.jsonl` (a chain, the lead register's helpers). It is the
 *   seat that published the report last when the lease is first needed, or
 *   the first seat to call done; a seat that is done, dead, compacting or
 *   silent past the stale limit is unavailable, and the next seat's done
 *   takes the lease over (generation + 1). Any other seat's `done` is
 *   answered "not yours", quietly: no board post, no finish line run, not a
 *   refusal.
 * - Readiness is computed from the registers for every revision (the open
 *   leads, the questions' answers and the ledger gate over them, the
 *   negatives, best candidates and route limitations), shown in every
 *   header, and posted once each time it turns ready or back.
 * - A check (the operator's finish line run for a done) is recorded with
 *   the revision it ran against, and a done at the same revision takes that
 *   result instead of running it again.
 * - The report is reviewed with typed acts: an ack of its digest ("no
 *   objection") is not a late post; an objection, or a result or veto
 *   posted after the report was written, needs the coordinator's typed
 *   resolution (folded into the report, or not material, with why) before
 *   the done goes on. Reading them is not enough.
 * - The final check is atomic over the report's digest and the state
 *   revision (protocol.ts stateRevision: the board's verdict posts, the
 *   ledger and its review, the leads, the questions, the jobs, the policy
 *   and the operator's decisions): the sentinel is written only while that
 *   revision still holds.
 * - The coordinator prepares the finish before its done (`finish prepare`,
 *   docs/adr/0015 "Preparing the finish"): the lease and the report's
 *   boundary are taken as a done takes them, with no goal check and no
 *   sentinel, and what is late against the report is listed whole, so it is
 *   resolved before the done rather than by a refused one (s993d40,
 *   sa2f2f2 and s5764c4: every first done was refused on late items, since
 *   only a done made the lease the late list needs). Late items are resolved
 *   in one typed batch, each item its own resolution event, against the
 *   generation and the report's digest the coordinator read, with an
 *   idempotency key. A resume opens a new segment of the finish and keeps
 *   what was still late by name.
 *
 * Nothing here judges an answer or reads a case: the registers say what is
 * open, and the operator's checks say whether the goal is met.
