"""Extract one data stream of an NTFS volume by inode, to a file, with icat.

The stream is written to `output` (a path under the run, never under inputs/), streamed: icat's standard
output goes straight to the file, so a stream of any size is never held in memory and never printed. The
answer is the record a reader cites: the output path, its size and sha256, the image, the offset in sectors,
the inode address as asked and as parsed (entry, attribute type, attribute id), icat's exit status and its
standard error, whole, in a file beside the output. A failed icat leaves what it wrote as `<output>.partial`
and the answer says so; it is never reported as an extraction.

The inode is a Sleuth Kit address: `168` (the default data attribute) or `168-128-4` (entry, attribute type,
attribute id, which names a stream such as an alternate data stream). `offset` is in SECTORS, as icat's -o
is. A file that already exists at `output` is never overwritten, and neither is anything this tool keeps
beside it: a second failed run leaves a second `.partial` and a second `.stderr` under the next free name,
and the answer names the file it kept. `output` is under work/<your id>/ (or work/extracted/<your id>/,
work/quarantine/<your id>/); run as a job, under $OUT, which the harness gives it when the path is written
work/<your id>/...: the run's other directories are read-only there and anywhere else are refused. This is the
same contract as the base pack's icat_extract (a named file, its size and digest), without its image catalogue.
