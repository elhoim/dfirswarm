/**
 * The host end of every agent's VM: the board's only writer, the trace's
 * door, the harness's voice, and the stop that does not depend on the agents.
 *
 * Between two microVMs a shared directory keeps none of the promises the
 * board is built on (spikes/microvm-smoke/shared-fs.sh measured it), so an
 * agent in a VM does not write the board. Its extension sends the call here
 * (extensions/board.ts), and this process runs the same `protocol.ts` against
 * the same files on the host, where there is one kernel and one writer.
 *
 * **Who is asking is the channel, not the message.** Each agent's VM has one
 * vsock port, and msb connects it to exactly one Unix socket here,
 * `<dir>/<agent>.sock`. A request that arrives on it is that agent's, and
 * every function that acts as someone is given that agent whatever the
 * request says. There is no token to steal: another VM cannot open this
 * agent's socket, and nothing in a request can change which socket it came
 * in on.
 *
 * **What an agent may ask for is an agent's business.** The agent table
 * holds the board functions a tool of the agent's calls. The harness's own
 * functions — the stop clock, the harness stop — are not in it: the
 * extension that used to call them runs inside the VM, where anything can
 * call anything, so in a VM they are this process's alone. Every path an
 * agent sends is resolved on the host without following a link the agent
 * planted (protocol.ts `openSandboxFile`), the sentinel is written only when
 * the operator's finish line passes here on the host, and a seat's spend
 * report may only grow.
 *
 * One socket carries four things, told apart by shape:
 *   - a trace line (an object with `tool` and `ts`), forwarded to the trace
 *     collector with this agent's token added, so the collector's own
 *     attribution, chain and anchor apply unchanged;
 *   - a nudge (`kind` and `peer`), the nudge broker's request, delivered here
 *     to the peer's link instead of through Herdr;
 *   - a board call (`t: "rpc"`);
 *   - the agent's link (`t: "hello"`), held open: the harness's prompts go
 *     down it, and the agent's working/idle state comes up it.
 *
 * No line either way is past P.WIRE_LINE_MAX: one write of about 262 KB
 * stalled msb's vsock path for good. Anything larger travels in parts of
 * P.TRANSFER_PART_BYTES, one at a time: a call's arguments (`t: "up"`, then
 * the call names its `argsUpload`), a trace line (`t: "up"`, then
 * `t: "trace"` names its `upload`), an answer or a prompt (announced with a
 * `download`, fetched with `t: "down"`). A line to a seat that would be past
 * the limit is refused by name instead of written.
 *
 * The admin socket, `<dir>/admin.sock`, is for the harness's own scripts on
 * the host (idle-nudge.sh, await-done.sh, swarm.sh): prompt an agent, read
 * who is working, tell the hub which Herdr pane is whose, and admit the
 * operator's acts on the question register (scripts/questions-cli.ts), so
 * the hub is that register's one writer while it runs.
 *
 * And the stop. The extension in each VM steers its own seat as it does on
 * the host; this process enforces the swarm's wall clock from outside, where
 * an agent cannot reach, on a clock of its own, and the caps on the spend
 * each seat reports about itself (a seat's report is its own word, and may
 * only grow): past the limit plus the grace period it writes the sentinel
 * itself, and once the sentinel has stood for the grace period it puts the
 * VMs away, records the run as finished and takes custody.
 *

 * One line of JSON on stdin: `{agents: [...], tokens: {<agent>: <token>},

 * the collector's attribution tokens, which no VM ever sees; `seat_tokens`
 * are the hello tokens, one to each seat's VM, which the hub asks of every
 * connection on that seat's socket. Tokens reach this process the way they reach the
 * collector, on stdin, never argv. What was given is kept in the hub's own
 * directory (0700, on the host, in no VM) so that `--resume` can bring the
 * hub back after a crash with the same tokens and the same clock.
