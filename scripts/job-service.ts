/**
 * The job service: tool work run in throwaway worker VMs, its outputs sealed
 * into the store, the catalogue updated from recipe results. A module of the
 * hub, the one writer of a run's shared state.
 *
 * A job is a pack or forged tool with its arguments, a shell command, a
 * recipe over one object, or a detect pass (which recipes apply to which
 * objects). Every step is an event in the evidence-work journal before the
 * next one starts:
 *
 *   job_accepted → job_started → job_finished → job_fenced → job_committed
 *                                                          ↘ (recipe) generation_committed → revision_published
 *
 * `fenced` is written only once msb says the worker is gone: until then no
 * byte of its staging directory is read, so nothing it could still write is
 * sealed. A job that fails keeps what it wrote (committed with its status);
 * one interrupted by the hub's own death is retried once, and its first
 * attempt's output is kept beside the second's.
 *
 * Who asked is recorded as the agent's id with the name and doing it had
 * given itself at that moment: context, never authority. A job that declares
 * what it reads is given only that (job-scope.ts: a view the hub builds for
 * it); one that declares nothing, or `all`, sees every object of the run, and
 * the record says which. What a worker could reach (its mounts, its network)
 * is recorded as the job's accessible scope, beside the scope the agent
 * declared and what that expanded to; what it actually read within that is
 * not measured and is said to be unknown.
 *
 * A brain's own output a finding cites (`tool:<seat>/<file>`, a whole output
 * the harness kept; `trace:<sha256>`, one line of the trace) is sealed here:
 * found on the trace (evidence-store.ts traceOrigin), snapshotted by the hub
 * at an import job's start and held to the trace's digest there, sealed like
 * any import, and published as `import:<id>/<file>` with its trace provenance.
