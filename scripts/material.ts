/**
 * What enters a run after its kickoff, from outside the evidence it was
 * given (docs/adr/0014): evidence acquired later (`swarm.sh evidence <run>
 * add`) and material the operator supplies (`swarm.sh material <run> add`,
 * and a question's attachment given as a file).
 *
 * Both go the store's import path: the file (or directory) is copied into a
 * staging directory of this addition's own, outside the run, each copy held
 * to its source's sha256; an import id is reserved (a directory made once,
 * which no other addition can make again); the copy is sealed as
 * `store/imports/<id>/` (read-only, every file in a manifest that must name
 * exactly the files copied, the bytes kept once in the store's blobs), and
 * the addition is committed by its record (`material.json`, the reason whole)
 * and its line on the store journal, taken one addition at a time under the
 * run's material lock, across processes.
 *
 * What it can be read as: every seat's VM mounts the run's directory
 * read-only, live, so once sealed the files are there at once, at
 * store/imports/<id>/out/, as they are to a host run's panes; jobs read them
 * as `import:<id>/<path>`. A finding cites them as import:<id>/<file> however
 * they were read; what they are (their class, who supplied them, when, what
 * they may be used for) is the ledger's external entry, never the path a
 * seat happened to read them by.
 *
 * What follows from a committed addition is derived from its record, each
 * step once and found again by the addition's id (the transactional outbox):
 * its external entry on the ledger (kind `external`, with its provenance
 * {supplied_by, at, from, sha256, permitted_use}; `acquired_evidence` for
 * evidence, `operator_supplied` or `case_material` for material; what each
 * class may be used for is the case policy's `material_use`); an
 * acquisition's received and validated stages (`--for R-n`, validated
 * against the sha256 the copy was held to); the closed leads resting on the
 * evidence as it was (under its questions, resolved through the question
 * register, and the request's own lead) reopened; the answers recorded
 * before it made stale and the acceptances made before it lifted; the
 * reverse sweep of its files for every standing coverage record's
 * looked_for strings started once it is committed, never inside it
 * (extensions/store-sweep.ts: a pass at a time in the hub's background or a
 * detached step, its hits delivered on the board and to the questions they
 * bear on, holding nothing); the catalogue queued when the
 * run's is on; the board told. The journal's
 * `addition_applied` line says all of it is recorded. A process that dies
 * after the commit leaves the rest to the next reconciliation (the hub's
 * round, the next addition, `swarm.sh evidence <run> list`), and the finish
 * line refuses a done while an addition's effects are not all recorded.
 *
 * A tool is material too (`swarm.sh tool-supply <run> add`): a program no image
 * holds, handed to a running run by the operator with what the harness cannot
 * know and the seats need to weigh it by: where it came from, how it was built
 * (both the operator's statement, recorded as such), and hashes the operator
 * checked, which the harness does check against the bytes it seals (a hash of
 * anything else goes in the words). It is sealed as `operator_supplied`, never
 * as evidence; its ledger entry carries that provenance in the chained core
 * (`provenance.tool`) and the board post tells the seats that a sealed file has
 * no execute bit and how to run it (a copy in an executable temporary directory
 * inside a job). The case policy's rules are the material's own: a policy that
 * says `operator_supplied=none` refuses it, because nothing recorded on its
 * output could be kept. The harness names no program and knows no format: the
 * file is whatever the operator says it is.
 *
 * Evidence is an inventory revision: its journal line counts it
 * (`inventory_rev`), and the negative bar's inventory revision moves with
 * it. Under the case policy's `more_evidence: no` it is refused: the case
 * admits no evidence after its kickoff.
 *
 * While the run's hub runs it is the store journal's one writer, so the act
 * is handed to it on its admin socket; with no hub the act is made here.
