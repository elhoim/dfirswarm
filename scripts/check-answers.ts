/**
 * A goal's check (ADR 0002): the questions rest on the ledger.
 *
 * Ledger mode (no --report; ledger version 4): each named section has its
 * `answer` entry — `question:<id>` for each of the goal's questions, and
 * `summary` and `narrative` when the goal names them — and the ledger gate
 * (extensions/protocol.ts, ledgerGate) finds nothing left open: every answer
 * still stands on what it cites (nothing it rests on superseded without its
 * correction cited, disputed or resting on a failed job without the answer
 * saying why, no answer it rests on fallen), a critic other than its author
 * attested or disputed it, it is not disputed itself, and no contradiction
 * stands that no answer weighs and no limitation names. A question's answer
 * rests on a standing finding whose refs resolve now, bytes checked where the
 * run sealed them (one of them an object of the run), a complete search where
 * the question asks whether something exists, or a limitation
 * (examination-limited). Each defect is printed with what fixes
 * it; a defect a standing limitation names lets the run end and stays a
 * defect (the release counts it). So the finish line refuses a done once,
 * naming the fix, and the next done passes when each defect left is named.
 * Tokens an answer asserts that no cited entry holds are counted, never
 * failed: that is the release's to weigh.
 *
 * Report mode (--report, the check goals used before version 4): every
 * named section of the report rests on the ledger. A section's entries are
 * those it cites (#<seq> or E-<seq>, a range such as #72–#74 too) and those
 * that name it in `answers`. It passes when one of them, standing, is:
 * - a finding with refs that all resolve, at least one of them an object of
 *   the run (unresolved:<why> alone names none): answered;
 * - a search that found nothing (absence), complete, with refs that resolve
 *   when it has any: answered, as not found, when the question asks whether
 *   something exists (the goal names those with --existence); for any other
 *   question it documents the search and no more, and the section is
 *   examination-limited. On the Belka run s306463 scoped negative searches
 *   counted as answers and the check said 18 answered, 0 examination-limited,
 *   while the critic's sign-off said several exact answers were unavailable;
 * - a limitation: the examination could not establish it, and says why:
 *   examination-limited, which a reader is told apart from answered.
 * A hypothesis never answers. A finding resting on the kept output of a job
 * that failed passes and is named. How sure the swarm said it was is not
 * asked: a check on confidence would teach a swarm to declare it. A ledger
 * whose chain is broken answers nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here knows a case: the goal names the sections, as its questions
 * are numbered, or points at the brief that numbers them. Run from the
 * sandbox, as every check is:
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings "$SWARM_HARNESS/scripts/check-answers.ts" \
 *     --sections 1,2,3,summary,narrative
 *   node … check-answers.ts --sections-in inputs/CASE.md --sections summary,narrative
 *   node … check-answers.ts --report work/report.md --sections 1,2,3        (report mode)
 *   node … check-answers.ts --sections 1,2,3,summary,narrative --existence 2
 *     (question 2 asks whether something exists: a complete search that found
 *     nothing answers it; for 1 and 3 it documents the search and no more)
 *
 * Exit 0 when every section does; 1 when one does not (each named, with what
 * it rests on, why none of it counts and what fixes it); 2 on a usage error.
