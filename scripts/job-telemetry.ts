/**
 * What a running job is doing, seen from the host without reading it (B11).
 *
 * On c09 one job wrote its only output 40 s after it started and then
 * nothing moved for 22.6 minutes until its holder cancelled it; stdout and
 * stderr stayed empty throughout. Nobody could tell a quiet healthy job from
 * a stuck one: a single-pass tool reading a 5 GB image is silent and
 * I/O-bound for minutes too. So three signals, each metadata only:
 *
 * 1. the job's output directory ($OUT, host staging): how many files, how
 *    many bytes, the newest file's time and its name, sanitised; walked
 *    without following a link, and bounded (the bound is said);
 * 2. its stdout and stderr: their sizes and times;
 * 3. its CPU and I/O: msb's metrics for the worker VM when the host has
 *    them, else the worker's own heartbeat (/job/heartbeat, written every
 *    15 s by the worker script from /proc/stat and /proc/diskstats: the VM
 *    runs this one job, so the VM's counters are the job's).
 *
 * "Suspected stall" only when all three are still for the stall window
 * (SWARM_JOB_STALL_SEC, 600) and the job is not within two minutes of its
 * timeout; "unknown" when the CPU and I/O signal is missing, since silence
 * alone proves nothing. The files are not sealed and not citable until the
 * job commits; cancelling a job keeps what it wrote; nothing here cancels
 * anything. Samples are kept beside the job's staging on the host
 * (telemetry.jsonl), so a restarted service reads them where they were.
 * Nothing here knows a tool or a format.
