/**
 * A package's two checks beyond its MANIFEST.txt (swarm.sh package, verify):
 *
 * redact <sandbox> <package dir> [--leaks fail|list]
 *   What a sensitive ledger entry says, and the objects it cites, are taken
 *   out of a package before it is handed over (GDPR or similar laws ask for
 *   no more than the purpose needs). A chained file keeps its chain: a
 *   redacted line is replaced by `{"redacted": true, "line_sha256": <the
 *   line's own hash>}` (a ledger entry keeps its seq, kind, prev and hash;
 *   an attestation or a dispute its act, target, prev and hash), so a
 *   recipient re-walks every chain and sees which lines it cannot read. A
 *   JSON file is redacted field by field, keeping its shape; any other text
 *   file word by word; a file a sensitive entry cites is replaced whole; a
 *   PDF a release printed is withheld. REDACTIONS.txt lists every change
 *   with the file's sha256 before and after, so the owner of the original
 *   can match it, and REDACTIONS.json what each replaced (the sha256 of the
 *   original, why, which entry). Then every file is scanned for each
 *   sensitive entry's words, normalised: a hit refuses the package (exit 5),
 *   or with --leaks list is recorded and said.
 *
 * components <sandbox> <package dir>
 *   COMPONENTS.json: each part a recipient holds the record to (the verdict,
 *   its anchor, its signature and token, the index of work/ custody sealed,
 *   the trace, the ledger, its attestations, the store's journal, the
 *   examiner's review), present or absent with why. Written before the
 *   manifest, so it is under the manifest's hash and its signature: a part
 *   taken out of a package, and out of the list, breaks the signature.
 *
 * verify <package dir>
 *   Every part the package should carry is there or declared absent; the
 *   chains it carries, re-walked (every ledger entry's core recomputed, a
 *   redacted one's hash taken as it stands): the trace, the ledger, its
 *   attestations, the store's journal and the examiner's review, each held
 *   to the custody verdict's seal (its lines and heads), the verdict to its
 *   anchor; every packaged work/ file held to the index custody sealed, and
 *   that index to the anchor.
 *
 * Nothing here knows a tool or an evidence format.
