/**
 * Reuse hints (docs/adr/0017): the work another seat already did, said when
 * a job is accepted, and the outputs that are byte for byte an earlier
 * job's, said when it is committed. Nothing is merged here: a hint names the
 * other job and its outputs, and the job runs as asked. Only a typed recipe
 * over the same object is answered with the earlier job (job-service.ts
 * recipeKey), because its identity is the recipe's own.
 *
 * What a job does is read at the level duplication happens, object ×
 * operation (the shadow key this replaces hashed the whole spec, timeout and
 * wording included, and matched none of 393, 127 and 190 keyed jobs in the
 * last CTF round):
 * - its objects: the declared scope as resolved (job-scope.ts), each file by
 *   its sha256 and each directory of the evidence, the store or the
 *   catalogue by its path (neither changes during a run). An agent's own
 *   work/ or tool-output/ file is live, and not known by its digest until
 *   the job starts: it is left out. A job that declares nothing, or `all`,
 *   has no objects to compare, and is never similar;
 * - its operation: a tool job's tool, a command's leading command word
 *   (protocol.ts leadingCommand), and whether the text or the arguments are
 *   the same, byte for byte.
 *
 * Only digests, paths and command words are read: no format, no tool's
 * output, nothing a program printed.
