/**
 * A program a job's worker could not execute, said where the agent reads the
 * job's result.
 *
 * In a worker nothing can run where it stands in store/ (sealTree keeps a
 * sealed file read-only, mode 0444, with no execute bit), in work/extracted/
 * or work/quarantine/ (read-only and no-exec), in inputs/ (no-exec) or in the
 * job's own $OUT and control directory (no-exec). A program supplied to the
 * run (swarm.sh tool-supply), or one unpacked from a supplied package into
 * $OUT, therefore fails there. On a live run (s3472f0) two jobs failed that
 * way, one with "exit 126" and one with "exit 127: a program it runs is not
 * in its image" (the loader's own words for a segment it could not map),
 * before a seat found the way: a copy in an executable temporary directory
 * inside the job.
 *
 * What the reply says depends on where the program stands, because the way
 * is not the same for everything. A supplied program (store/imports/mat-*) is
 * run from a copy. Evidence (inputs/, work/extracted/, work/quarantine/, an
 * evidence import) is read, never run: the contract flags a job that runs code
 * recovered from it and asks for a reimplementation, a trusted program or the
 * operator's word first, so the reply sends the seat to the operator's
 * tool-supply, not to a recipe for running it. Anywhere else (the job's own
 * $OUT, an earlier job's output, no path found) it says both, in that order.
 * And the shell's other reasons for 126 (a file built for another machine, an
 * interpreter that is missing, a directory) are not about where a program
 * stands: the shell's own line is quoted and no copy is suggested.
 *
 * A job that ended non-zero is read, on the shell's and the loader's own
 * words only: the exit status 126 (the shell found the command and could not
 * execute it), with the shell's line that names the program when there is one
 * ("Permission denied", "cannot execute binary file", "bad interpreter", "Is a
 * directory"); the dynamic loader's "failed to map segment from shared
 * object", at any status; and, at another status, a "Permission denied" that
 * names a file which exists under a directory a worker mounts read-only
 * (store/, inputs/, work/extracted/, work/quarantine/), where a write is
 * refused with "Read-only file system" and an existing file that cannot be
 * opened is one that cannot be executed (a program run by a program that
 * reports its own status, a Python subprocess call). A "Permission denied"
 * anywhere else at another status is not read here: nothing in the line tells
 * a program that could not be executed from a file that could not be written
 * (a read-only directory in $OUT), and a denied write is
 * job-write-refused.ts's. The job's stdout, its stderr and every stderr file
 * it kept in $OUT are read whole, a line at a time. Generic: no program is
 * named or recognised.
