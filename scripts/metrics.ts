/**
 * Process metrics of a run, read from its own registers: no truth, no case,
 * no tool's output (docs/adr/0017, the definitions in docs/usage.md).
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/metrics.ts <run-dir> [--json]
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/metrics.ts --compare <run-dir-A> <run-dir-B> [--json]
 *   swarm.sh metrics <id> [--json]
 *   swarm.sh metrics --compare <id-A> <id-B> [--json]
 *
 * What is read, and nothing else: the lead register (leads/leads.jsonl, and
 * the finish register leads/finish.jsonl where the run has one), the question
 * register, the ledger with its attestations and disputes, the operator
 * requests, the store's journal (jobs, reuse hints, evidence added), the
 * network's grants and fetches, the trace (done calls, the hub's refusals),
 * the run's end (done/SWARM_DONE, done/STOPPED) and the seats' token records
 * (the model gateway's log, else the Pi sessions). A register a run does not
 * have is said to be absent, never read as zero: a run from before offers
 * has no offer events, one from before the reuse hints no job_similar lines.
 *
 * Each figure is a count of named records, and the JSON lists them (ids,
 * sections, seats, times, reason codes), so a figure can be checked against
 * the register it came from. No free text a record carries is copied, in
 * the table or the JSON: no answer value, no finding, no command, no
 * dispute's or done's why. A metric says what the process did, never what
 * the case holds. The questions a run is measured against are the ones in
 * its scope at its end (Q.liveInScope); an answer to a question since
 * withdrawn or excluded is listed apart, as history.
 *
 * `--compare` sets two runs of the same goal side by side, question by
 * question: each one's standing result, whether it was reviewed, its
 * coverage and acceptance, and where they agree or disagree. A negative in
 * one run that the other established is flagged; so is agreement on a
 * negative resting on partial coverage in both, which may be a shared blind
 * spot rather than a confirmation. Neither run's conclusions are shown to the
 * other: this is read after both ended.
