# Contributing

Thanks for looking. This is a small project with strong opinions; the
opinions are written down so you do not have to guess them.

## What it is, in one line

N peer coding agents share one sandbox and coordinate on a file board; the
harness enforces leases, caps, a stop signal and a log. Everything the swarm
may decide, it decides on the board; everything that must not be negotiable
lives in the harness. Read [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) for the vocabulary before
you name anything.

## Setting up

```sh
git clone https://github.com/halilozturkci/dfirswarm && cd dfirswarm
nvm use            # .nvmrc → Node 22
npm ci
npm run typecheck  # server + UI
npm test           # every node suite under tests/, no key, no Herdr
npm run test:bash  # every shell suite: certification, preflight, model teams, reaper, netguard, images, packs, microVM flags
npm run ui:build
# on a host that can boot a microVM (Apple silicon, or Linux with /dev/kvm) and has the base image loaded:
DFIRSWARM_VM_TESTS=1 npm run test:vm   # real VMs, one run end to end with a scripted model
```

On an Apple-silicon Mac, run the VM suite locally: the hosted macOS CI
runner cannot boot one. With `dfirswarm-base:dev-arm64` and
`dfirswarm-disk:dev-arm64` loaded into msb, require the prerequisites and
include the disk-catalog cases:

```sh
DFIRSWARM_VM_TESTS=1 VM_TEST_CATALOG_IMAGE=dfirswarm-disk:dev-arm64 npm run test:vm
```

`DFIRSWARM_VM_TESTS=1` turns a missing runtime or base image into a failure
instead of a skipped suite. `VM_TEST_CATALOG_IMAGE` makes the named image's
Sleuth Kit tools and the resulting disk catalogue mandatory.
`node --experimental-strip-types scripts/vm.ts probe --image IMAGE`
checks the prerequisites; `msb-path` prints the bundled executable, so no
global `msb` installation is needed. See `images/README.md` to build and load
the images. The tests use synthetic inputs and a scripted local model.

That is everything CI runs, and none of it needs a model, a key, Herdr or a
Pi login. CI runs the typecheck, the node suites and the shell suites on
amd64 Linux and on macOS (Apple silicon), and the VM suite on amd64 Linux,
where it boots the base and disk images under KVM. A hosted macOS runner
cannot boot a microVM, so the Apple-silicon VM path is run by hand before a
release. A pull request that touches `images/` or a pack's requirements
also builds every profile for amd64 and two (memory, re) for arm64
(`images.yml`), without booting them. Once a week `image-boot.yml` builds
every profile, boots each as an agent's VM under KVM (the probe, its verdict
and Pi end to end), checks it against its packs with the kickoff's
`imageFit`, and does the same for base on arm64 where that runner has KVM;
it pushes nothing. Actions are pinned by commit, with the tag beside each.
The `spikes/` directory is neither typechecked (`tsconfig.json` covers
`extensions/`, `scripts/` and `tests/`) nor re-run: its scripts record
measurements made once, and they can go stale. The host suites run on
Node 22 (`.nvmrc`), and on exactly 22.19.0, the `engines` floor the pinned Pi
needs, in a job of their own; Pi in a VM runs on the image's Node 24
(`images/base.Dockerfile`), and CI runs the node suites on Node 24 as well.

`npm ci` brings Pi's own package in as a devDependency, for the
extension's types and the loader test (`tests/pi-load.test.ts` loads the
extension through that pinned package's own loader); a real run still needs
[Herdr](https://herdr.dev) and [Pi](https://pi.dev) installed and logged in
on the machine; see the README's quick start. A whole swarm with real
panes and no key is possible with the scripted provider
(`docs/proof-run.md`) — that still needs Herdr.

## Rules of the house

- **Tests live in `tests/`.** Node suites are `node:test` with
  `--experimental-strip-types`; shell suites are plain bash. A new
  `tests/<name>.test.ts` or `tests/<name>.test.sh` runs by its name: nothing
  lists the suites (`scripts/test-node.ts`, `scripts/test-bash.sh`), and the
  few node suites `npm test` must leave out are in `tests/node-tests.skip`,
  each with its reason. `npm test` gives each test five minutes, so a test
  that waits forever fails by name instead of hanging CI; a wait in a test is
  set up before the event it waits for can happen (listen for a child's
  `exit` when it is spawned, not after). A change to the
  protocol needs a case in `tests/dry-run.test.ts`; a change to the web API
  needs one in `tests/ui-server.test.ts`; a change to `swarm.sh` usually needs
  one in `tests/swarm-preflight.test.sh` or `tests/model-teams.test.sh`,
  which lift the helper out of the script rather than re-implementing it.
- **Shell scripts must run on bash 3.2** (macOS ships it). No `declare -A`,
  no `${arr[@]}` on a possibly-empty array without the `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}`
  guard, no `mapfile`.
- **No MCP servers in tests.** The suites talk to files and to a local HTTP
  server; nothing else.
- **English everywhere in the repository**: code, comments, commit messages,
  docs, the board prompts. The UI is English-only.
- **The harness owns its files.** If a change lets an agent write
  `SWARM.md`, `budget.json`, `done/` or `locks/` through a tool, it is a bug.
- **Mark what you did not verify.** The docs use **UNKNOWN** for anything
  guessed at. Keep doing that rather than writing a confident sentence.

## Adding a UI state

Seed it into the fixture (`scripts/seed-fixture.ts`) so the web API tests and
`npm run ui:fixture` can show it without a model, then add the screen to
`docs/ui-coverage.md`. Screenshots in the README are captured with Playwright
against real runs; refresh them when the design changes.

## Commits and pull requests

- One change per commit, with a message that says why. The existing history
  reads as release notes; keep it that way.
- AI-assisted commits are welcome. Say so in the trailer
  (`Co-Authored-By:`), as the history already does.
- A pull request should say which suite covers it and, for anything touching
  a live run, which swarm id proved it (`scripts/swarm.sh status <id>`).
- Do not commit anything from `runs/`, `.pi-sessions/` or a real
  provider key. `.gitignore` covers the usual places; look anyway.

### The changelog

A pull request writes its entry to `changelog.d/<branch-slug>.md`, the branch
name with `/` as `-` (`claude/merge-hygiene` → `claude-merge-hygiene.md`),
never to `CHANGELOG.md`: each branch adds a file of its own, so two branches
do not conflict at the top of one section. The fragment is one or more
sections under a `### <Kind>: …` heading, the kinds `CHANGELOG.md` uses
(Added, Changed, Fixed, Security, …), written as its entries are;
`tests/changelog.test.ts` checks its shape. Name a pack, not its version: a
version can still be raised when the branch is brought up to date.
When the owner cuts a release,
`node --experimental-strip-types scripts/changelog.ts --fold --release X.Y.Z`
folds every fragment into `[Unreleased]`, newest first (by when each landed),
turns that section into the version's, and removes the fragments; without
`--release` it only folds. Read `git diff`, then commit.

### Bringing a branch up to date with main

Packs carry their own checksums and version, and the kickoff goldens and
`docs/rules.md` are generated, so two branches that touch the same pack or
the kickoff conflict there even when their sources merge cleanly. Whoever
merges brings the branch up to date in one step, and a branch that falls
behind again is fixed by running it again:

```sh
git fetch origin && git merge origin/main   # stop at the conflicts, if any
bash scripts/merge-prep.sh                  # --base REF if not origin/main
git diff --cached                           # read what is staged, then commit
```

In a rebase, run it at each commit that stops on a conflict and once more
when the rebase has finished.

`scripts/merge-prep.sh` resolves a conflict in a generated file rather than
asking for it to be edited: a pack's `pack.json` key by key (what the seal
writes and the version are written again; a hand-written key both sides
changed stops it, named), a pack's `skills/INDEX.md`, the goldens and the
rule register by writing them again. It seals every pack whose files differ
from main's; a pack that differs from main's while its version is not above
main's gets main's version with the patch raised, so two different packs
never carry one version (`docs/packs.md`, "Versions"). It writes the kickoff
goldens and the rule register again and checks the changelog fragments. It
stages everything it wrote, so the commit that ends the merge carries it, and
lists what is staged and what is not. Any other conflict, or a `pack.json` key
it cannot merge, stops it before it writes anything. It commits nothing. CI's
own checks stay: `tests/packs.test.sh` verifies every shipped pack, the
`pack-versions` job compares a pull request's packs with its base (a clean
merge can land two packs under one version, so this one catches what nobody
ran merge-prep for), `tests/kickoff-goldens.test.sh` compares the goldens and
`tests/rules-register.test.ts` the register.

## Licence and the name

nothing about your rights as a user of the project. If you are contributing
work your employer has rights in, read § 7 of it before you open the pull

The code is AGPL; the name is not. [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md) says what you
may call your own work. The short version: fork freely, and give the fork its
own name.
