# Open-source release checklist

Status as of 2026-09-17. Everything an engineer could do is done; the three
steps at the end are the maintainer's, in order.

## Done

| # | Item | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | License: GNU AGPL v3 or later, copyright Halil Öztürkci, 2026, with a commercial licence offered alongside it. The console and the server banner carry the section 13 source offer | `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md`, `package.json` `license`, README § License, `ui/src/components/app-shell.tsx`, `scripts/ui-server.ts` |
| 2 | Name: **Agent Swarm** everywhere (was "Simple Swarm" during development) | `package.json`, `ui/index.html`, the wordmark, the server's placeholder page, `extensions/agent-swarm.ts` (renamed), every doc |
| 3 | Security policy: threat model, scope, reporting, operator hardening | `SECURITY.md` |
| 4 | CI: typecheck, the node suites, every shell suite (`scripts/test-bash.sh`), UI build, a guard that no run state is tracked — no model, key, Herdr or Pi needed; and on a KVM runner the VM suite, with the base and disk images built from the recipes. `images.yml` builds every profile, `full` included | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/images.yml` |
| 5 | Contributing guide with the house rules (tests in `tests/`, bash 3.2, English only, harness owns its files) | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| 6 | Code of conduct: Contributor Covenant 2.1 | `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` |
| 7 | Issue and PR templates, Dependabot for npm and Actions | `.github/` |
| 8 | `package.json` metadata: name, version 0.3.0, description, license, author, repository, bugs, homepage, keywords; stays `private` (a CLI + web app, not a library) | `package.json` |
| 9 | README is a landing page: why, a feature tour where each screenshot is a published forensic run, a quick start, what the harness enforces, a documentation table; everything else lives in `docs/` | `README.md`, `docs/quick-start.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/safety.md`, `docs/observability.md`, `docs/why-the-incident-inverted.md`, `docs/screenshots.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/protocol.md`, `docs/usage.md`, `docs/component-map.md`, `docs/verified-runs.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md` |
| 10 | English only: the one Turkish document translated; the worker prompt asks agents to post in English; screenshots recaptured from English runs | `docs/feature-evidence.md`, `prompts/worker-system.md`, `docs/screenshots/` |
| 11 | Screenshots captured with Playwright from real runs: the README and the gallery use the forensic series, and every image links to the case whose board and report are in the repository | `docs/screenshots.md`, `docs/use-cases/*/screenshots/`, `docs/screenshots/` |
| 12 | Changelog from the commit history | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| 13 | Node pin | `.nvmrc` (22) |
| 14 | A finished swarm's netguard sidecar is stopped by the last agent to leave | `stopNetguardSidecarIfOver` in `extensions/protocol.ts` |
| 15 | GitHub description and topics | repository settings |
| 16 | No secrets and no run state in tracked files: grepped for API-key and token shapes and for private-key blocks, in the working tree and across the whole history. The one private-key hit is a forensic finding in a report table, not key material | — |
| 17 | The maintainer's home path appears 2,594 times in published run artifacts, all of it `~/DFIR/SampleCases` and `~/Library/Python` in verbatim pane captures and custody sections. Reviewed and kept: the username is already the GitHub handle, nothing else is disclosed, and rewriting a terminal capture would cost it the thing it is published for | `docs/use-cases/*/run/panes/`, `docs/use-cases/*/run/summary.md` |
| 18 | Contributor agreement, referenced from the contributing guide and ticked in the pull-request template | `CLA.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` |
| 19 | Trademark policy: what the Apache licence deliberately does not grant, and what a fork may call itself | `TRADEMARK.md`, README § License |
| 20 | Every relative link in every Markdown file resolves (259 files, 0 broken) | — |
| 21 | Issue chooser routes a vulnerability to the security policy instead of a public issue | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` |

## Not done, on purpose

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| A hosted demo | Impossible by design: a run needs Herdr panes and a paid or subscribed model. A screen recording linked from the README would be the substitute. |
| Publishing to npm | It is a CLI and a web app you clone; `private: true` stays. |
| macOS `pf` enforcement for netguard | Still **UNKNOWN**; the proxy mode is what is verified on macOS. Listed in the README roadmap. |

## The maintainer's own steps

These are the ones no contributor can do. In order.

1. **Make CI able to run.** The workflow is correct and every suite passes
   locally, but no run has ever started on this repository: GitHub Actions is
   blocked by the account's billing. Until that is cleared the README badge
   has no status to show, which on a public repository reads as a project
   whose tests do not pass. Settings → Billing.
2. **Enable private vulnerability reporting the moment the repository is
   public.** It cannot be switched on while the repository is private, and
   `SECURITY.md` names it first. The published fallback is
   halil@halilozturkci.com, which is now a real address in a public file and
   will be scraped; a filter for it is worth setting up before the flip.
3. **Register the name.** [TRADEMARK.md](../TRADEMARK.md) claims "DFIR Swarm"
   as an unregistered mark, which is worth something and worth less than a
   registration. Section 6 of the Apache licence is what makes the name the
   part worth protecting.
4. **Have a lawyer read `CLA.md`.** It is a working document, not reviewed
   advice, and it is the instrument that decides whether this project can ever
   change its own licence.
5. **Decide the version.** `package.json` says 0.3.0 and the changelog's
   `[Unreleased]` section has held every change since. Nothing was ever tagged
   or released, so the first public tag can be 0.3.0 or a new minor; pick one,
   cut the changelog section to match, then
   `git tag -a vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` and a GitHub release with
   that section as its body.
6. **Flip the repository to public** (Settings → General → Danger Zone →
   Change visibility), then immediately enable **private vulnerability
   reporting** (Settings → Security) and set the description and topics.

Optional afterwards: a 60-second recording of `swarm.sh start` → the console → the sentinel; a pinned issue for "first run help"; the `pi`/`herdr` versions tested, kept current in the quick start.
