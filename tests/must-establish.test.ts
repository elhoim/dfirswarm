/**
 * A question that must be established (docs/adr/0013, "A question that must
 * be established"). On the Breadcrumbs run (a flag-only challenge, --stop
 * operator) the one question's answer was partial on a reviewed finding,
 * which is a disposition under the bar, so the coordinator's done ended the
 * run examination-limited after 23 minutes without the flag; the operator
 * resumed it and asked the question again by hand. The goal (a `## Must
 * establish` section, or `must_establish:` in its metadata block) and the
 * operator (`question add --must-establish`, `amend --must-establish`) can
 * now say that a question must be established: for it, partial, not
 * determinable, a bounded negative short of the stronger bar and out of
 * scope are no disposition, under every stop policy. The ways out stay on
 * the record: the operator accepts its limits (question accept, for that
 * revision and the answer standing) or releases the requirement (amend
 * --no-must-establish, with why). A question that does not use it reads as
 * it always did. Synthetic runs only.
