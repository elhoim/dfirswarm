/**
 * What a stop does to the job service's work (scripts/job-service.ts). On
 * the Breadcrumbs run a job's worker was started while `swarm.sh stop` put
 * the seats away; the stop's removal of that worker and the job's own raced,
 * msb could not say whether the worker was gone, and the hub went with the
 * job's staging directory unsealed and nothing on the record but that one
 * fence. Here, with a stand-in worker:
 *
 * - once a stop is under way (the hub's `.stop`) no new worker is started
 *   and no new job accepted, and what waits is cancelled on the record;
 * - the service's own stop asks again for a worker not confirmed gone and
 *   seals its job once it is (`job_fenced` by the stop);
 * - one still not confirmed gone is accounted for (`job_unsealed`, with its
 *   staging directory and why), custody names it with that why, and
 *   `vm.ts seal-left` seals it after the run once msb says it is gone;
 * - a job the hub left running is sealed as stopped; a staging directory no
 *   job owns is named and left as it is; nothing is sealed while a hub runs,
 *   found by hub.pid or, when a stop that gave up on it dropped that, by its
 *   own command line.
