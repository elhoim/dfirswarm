/**
 * Real microVMs, the way a run makes them (scripts/vm.ts) and serves them
 * (scripts/vm-hub.ts). Needs a host that can boot one — macOS on Apple
 * silicon, or Linux with /dev/kvm — and the base image (VM_TEST_IMAGE,
 * default dfirswarm-base:dev-<arch>). Skipped otherwise, unless
 * DFIRSWARM_VM_TESTS=1 says the host must be able to (CI's KVM job).
 *
 *   npm run test:vm
 *
 * What it proves, each against the host's own view of the files:
 *   - guest root cannot write the run's floor, the evidence or the trace, by
 *     writing, remounting or unmounting — and unmounting a writable hole
 *     leaves the read-only floor, not the host;
 *   - a VM reaches its allowed host and nothing else, by name or by address,
 *     and a local model's port on the host but no other port;
 *   - a secret never enters the guest, only its placeholder, and is in no
 *     kept disk or log after finish;
 *   - two VMs posting and recording at once through the hub lose nothing and
 *     never share an id — the failure the shared directory had;
 *   - in a VM the shared work/ is read-only, a peer's directory is not one's
 *     own, extracted material (one's own or a peer's) does not run, and a
 *     deliverable is published through the hub with its bytes;
 *   - a tool forged through the hub, and one seeded like a pack's, runs in a
 *     VM only as its sealed bytes; a VM's own file is recorded and restored
 *     without the hub opening it;
 *   - a claim on a file a peer just published waits out the guest cache
 *     (the default settle, not zero);
 *   - finish snapshots and removes a run's VMs, and reap touches only the VMs
 *     its own registry recorded;
 *   - end to end, Pi in its VM calls a scripted model and posts through the
 *     hub, with the evidence refused to it by the kernel.
