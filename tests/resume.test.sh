# start options were not kept (given after -- instead); the stop moved aside
# whole; the question asked for the continuation admitted as an analyst's;
# each seat's hand-off put where it starts; the resume on the operator's
# record, the registry and the custody anchor; the next stop seals a new
# verdict and a new draft, and custody-verify holds the first seal as a
# prefix of the run now. No model, no VM; Herdr is never started (--no-start).
