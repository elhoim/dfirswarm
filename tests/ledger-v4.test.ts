/**
 * The ledger's version 4 (two rounds between Claude, Fable and GPT-6-Astra
 * on a report that interprets): a finding says what it indicates, how sure
 * and why, and what else could explain it; the hub writes how each cited
 * object was made; an answer rests on the entries it cites by hash, every
 * claimed support checked at record and marked when it falls later,
 * transitively; tokens an answer asserts that no cited entry holds are
 * marked, never refused; attest and dispute are chained acts beside the
 * ledger; and the goal's check refuses a done once, naming the fix, and lets
 * the next through when a limitation names each defect left. Old ledgers
 * verify as they always did.
