/**
 * A downgrade needs counter-evidence (docs/adr/0013, "After the round-13
 * scoring" and "After the run s9722fa"): a revision that moves an answer
 * from established or partial to not determinable or a bounded negative
 * names what undermines the earlier chain, or it is refused and pointed to a
 * dispute and a lower strength; a dispute is still how a doubt is said. What
 * it names bears against the chain (a finding that contradicts it, a
 * refuted hypothesis tied to it, an entry it rests on under a dispute, a
 * correction of one): limitations and the downgrader's own coverage do not.
 * While a positive finding the earlier answer rested on still stands, the
 * revision is refused and pointed to a partial answer. Synthetic runs only.
