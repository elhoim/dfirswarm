## Findings

- **#4** a remote tool installed at 09:14 [answers 2; observed] _(high)_ — source: the log — evidence: line 12 — refs: `job:j000002/hits.txt` — indicates: What the observation shows, and the step to it. — why that confidence: Read directly from the object it cites. — made by: job j000002: command `search` in unknown (unknown), ok — by a0

## Answers

- **#3** question:1 (bounded_negative) **(negative, unreviewed)**: No evidence of the event of question 1 was found on the disk **(superseded by #10)** _(medium: The cited entries are direct.)_ — rests on: E-2 — still open: none open — would change it: a second source that disagrees — reasoning: E-2 — by a1
- **#6** question:2 (established): A remote tool, installed at 09:14 **(superseded by #11)** [attested by a3] _(high: The cited entries are direct.)_ — rests on: E-4, E-5 — still open: none open — would change it: a second source that disagrees — reasoning: E-4, searched as E-5 — by a1
- **#10** question:1 (bounded_negative) (negative, reviewed by a2): No evidence of the event of question 1 was found on the disk or in the proxy export (corrects #3) _(medium: The cited entries are direct.)_ — rests on: E-9 — still open: none open — would change it: a second source that disagrees — reasoning: E-9 — by a1
- **#11** question:2 (established): A remote tool, installed at 09:14, as the log shows (corrects #6) [attested by a3] _(high: The cited entries are direct.)_ — rests on: E-4, E-5 — still open: none open — would change it: a second source that disagrees — reasoning: E-4, searched as E-5 — by a1
