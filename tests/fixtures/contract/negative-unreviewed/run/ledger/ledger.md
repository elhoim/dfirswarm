## Findings

- **#1** the record question 1 asks for [answers 1; observed] _(high)_ — source: the disk — evidence: a registry key — refs: `job:j000001/hits.txt` — indicates: What the observation shows, and the step to it. — why that confidence: Read directly from the object it cites. — made by: job j000001: command `search` in unknown (unknown), ok — by a0

## Answers

- **#2** question:1 (established): Established: the record question 1 asks for [attested by a2] _(high: The cited entries are direct.)_ — rests on: E-1 — still open: none open — would change it: a second source that disagrees — reasoning: E-1 — by a1
- **#5** question:2 (bounded_negative) **(negative, unreviewed)**: No evidence of a remote tool was found on the disk _(medium: The cited entries are direct.)_ — rests on: E-4 — still open: none open — would change it: a second source that disagrees — reasoning: E-4 — by a1

## Coverage records

- **#4** for question:2: proposition: The event question 2 asks about happened [answers 2] — objects: `input:disk.E01` — time range: the whole of each object, no time bound — method: a keyword search (settings: case-insensitive, every encoding the tool offers) — covered: every byte of the objects named — skipped: none: the search ran to its end — failures: none — results: E-3, job:j000001/hits.txt — alternatives: the event may have left its trace only in memory, which the case does not hold — detection opportunity: trace expected yes, the event writes to the objects searched, and they keep it — inventory 6b7f01894e8e2a6c059e2d4d6130c309436116548ea9697440118f05b264e3db — **coverage complete** — no literal form to look for: the fixture's event has no literal form a byte search could find — **unreviewed** — by a0
