/**
 * The negative bar under review (Astra's review of WP2): each case below
 * failed on the code before its fix.
 *
 * - A coverage record binds its results by hash: a result superseded,
 *   disputed or changed after the record takes the record, and the reviewed
 *   negative resting on it, out of standing.
 * - premise_not_supported rests on a finding; one resting on a search alone
 *   meets the negative bar, and "it did not happen" is checked whatever the
 *   result.
 * - An acceptance is bound to the answer it accepted: a replacement answer
 *   is held to the negative bar, and the acceptance no longer stands.
 * - The report states a negative in the bounded form the harness makes from
 *   the coverage record; the agents' own words follow, marked as theirs.
 * - The hub's object coverage names objects as the job scopes do: a digest
 *   of an input is that input, a store path is its job's output, a
 *   catalogue directory holds its members, and a coverage record takes a
 *   directory of the evidence as its object.
