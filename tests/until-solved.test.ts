/**
 * An until-solved run at the protocol level: every cap advisory and no wall
 * clock (each pressure the brakes read says nothing is over), no abandon (a
 * vote or not), and a finish line that takes every question in scope with a
 * disposition under the bar, the same as any run (the dispositions
 * themselves: tests/until-solved-dispositions.test.ts): a question with none,
 * a finish line that could not be run and an abandon are all refused, each
 * naming what is not disposed and what blocks it. The model gateway refuses no call for a cap. The regroup lists what is
 * open, blocked, waiting on the operator and uncited.
