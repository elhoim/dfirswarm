/**
 * Coordination of the work (Plan 3, WP4; docs/adr/0015): the coverage check
 * at open and claim, staggered first choices and stable names (A1); the
 * hand-off, prerequisites with their product, parked leads and blocked
 * holders counted idle (A2); offers from delivery, declined, lapsed,
 * invalidated, restart-safe, skipping seats that cannot take them, a reopen
 * offered to the previous holder, and a superseded closure confirmed or
 * reopened, never re-pointed (A3); one mechanism for leads and questions.
 * Concurrency: two seats racing for an offered lead, two waits electing at
 * once, a restart in the middle of an offer, and a compacting seat.
