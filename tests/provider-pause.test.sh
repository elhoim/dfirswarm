# The pause for the model provider's limit, from the watchdog's side, and the
# operator's pause and unpause from the command line (docs/adr/0013). A run
# whose every seat was refused on a stated wait of days is paused by the
# watchdog, said once on the board and once to the operator's notify command,
# and nobody is nudged; at the named end the harness lifts it and wakes every
# seat with words that say so. swarm.sh pause holds a run and unpause lifts
# it, both on the operator's record; unpause refuses a cap's pause still over
# its cap, and a run that is not going. A pause a resume folded into the
# history wakes nobody. Under cap-pause a refused seat is retried, and every
# seat refused again with no time named pauses the run; an extension leaves
# that pause. No model, no VM; Herdr is a stand-in that records what it is
# told.
