/**
 * Preparing the finish, and late items resolved in one batch (docs/adr/0015,
 * "Preparing the finish"; the limits spec, item 3). `finish prepare` takes
 * the lease and the report's boundary as a done takes them, runs no check
 * and writes no sentinel, and lists readiness and every late item; a
 * prepare again, a republished report, a takeover and a resume keep what
 * was late until it is resolved. `finish resolve` with items records one
 * resolution per item, against the generation and the report's digest,
 * validated whole under the lock, with an idempotency key. The final
 * transaction is unchanged: a veto, an objection or an evidence addition
 * racing the done still holds the sentinel. And the metric: a run whose
 * only first-done refusal would have been late items has none when the
 * coordinator prepares and resolves in one batch.
