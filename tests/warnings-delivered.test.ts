/**
 * The answers check's warnings delivered where the decision is made
 * (docs/adr/0013, "Warnings where the decision is made"): in the reply to
 * the record that writes the answer, in the review offered for it and the
 * reply to an attest on it, in the reply to a lead's close or confirmation
 * that changes them, and in finish status, each in the same words, none
 * holding. lead_findings_uncited covers what the record ties to a question
 * outside its leads too: a finding or an event that names the question
 * (one seat is enough), or one two seats hold whose rel links it to an
 * entry the answer cites. And the
 * request guidance: a question put to the operator says what would settle
 * it, a value read from an image comes from a job that read it, and under
 * more_evidence: no nothing suggests an ask. Synthetic runs only.
