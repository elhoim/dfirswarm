# A build that lost a program is not an image. With the Docker VM's disk full,
# apt failed inside the optional builder stages of bulk_extractor and
# aeskeyfind; those stages still ended well, Docker cached them as they were,
# and every image built after the disk was freed lacked both programs, saying
# so only under not_installed in its image.json, until a --no-cache rebuild.
#
# This plays that failure without filling a disk and without Docker: apt-get
# is a script here that fails the way apt does when the disk is full, for the
# packages the test names. What must hold:
#   - a builder stage whose optional program did not build fails (exit 1), so
#     Docker caches nothing of it; one pinned for other architectures, or one
#     the build allows to fail, ends well with the failure recorded;
#   - at the end of the profile's install, every program the packs name is on
#     PATH unless it was left out on purpose, or the install fails, so the
#     image is never tagged; --allow-missing-optional builds it anyway and the
#     record names what is missing (missing_allowed);
#   - a stage allowed to fail carries a build id of its own, different in every
#     context, so no build takes an earlier failure from the cache;
#   - tests/image-programs.sh fails a program the image's record names and
#     PATH lacks, rather than skipping it.
