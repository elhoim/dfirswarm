/**
 * A program a job's worker could not execute is said in its reason

 * files have no execute bit), work/extracted/, work/quarantine/, inputs/ or
 * the job's own $OUT can run in place; a seat that supplied itself a program
 * found the way (a copy in an executable temporary directory inside the job)
 * only after two failed jobs, each of which said "exit 126" or "exit 127: a
 * program it runs is not in its image". What the reply says depends on where
 * the program stands: a supplied program is run from a copy, evidence is read
 * and never run, and the shell's other reasons for 126 are quoted. The match
 * is on the shell's exit status, its own lines and the loader's words; no
