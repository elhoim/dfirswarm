/**
 * The premise register and an answer's claim and open-part rows

 * (the goal, the register's premise add) or proposed by an agent under
 * test; answers citing them at a revision with a stance; the gate
 * premise_inconsistent and its ways out, none of which forces either side;
 * parts established or open, a partial answer with no open part refused, a
 * premise never an open part; a review's parts by id and a part it says the
 * answer leaves out; the warnings; the dispute a rebutting finding opens;
 * the report, the register's views and the CLI; and an answer without the
