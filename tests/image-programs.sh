# Run INSIDE a built image (a container, or a microVM booted from it), not on
# the host: the images workflow mounts tests/ and runs it in every profile
# image, and it is how a locally built image is checked before it is loaded
# into msb. Each check is for a program the packs put in an image because a
# run asked for it and none had it:
#
#   gcc             compiles and runs a C program
#   aeskeyfind      finds an AES-128 and an AES-256 key schedule planted in
#                   random bytes (a key finder is relied on only after its own
#                   planted-key test)
#   steghide, PIL   embeds a short message in a JPEG made here and extracts it
#
# A program the image does not hold is skipped when its packs do not name it:
# the profiles differ (the base and web hold none of these). One its packs
# name (a key of `binaries` in /etc/dfirswarm/image.json) and that is not on
# PATH fails: a build that lost it (apt out of disk space did) is caught here
# too, not only by install.py at the end of the build. One the build was told
# it may lack (`missing_allowed`, recipe.py build --allow-missing-optional) is
# skipped, and says so; a record that cannot be read fails, since it cannot
# say which. Nothing here is evidence, a secret or a challenge: the
# keys and the message are made up and thrown away.
