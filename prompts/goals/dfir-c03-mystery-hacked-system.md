## Goal

A Windows 8.1 workstation image prepared for a Windows and file system forensics course. One day an IT department employee came to work and found a message written in a file on their system; they reported it. Find out how the system was hacked and prove it.

The evidence is under `inputs/` (read-only; call `inputs` to list it):
`inputs/Windows8.1-Challenge3.001`, a 26.5 GB raw disk image of a Windows 8.1 machine (MD5 9a737b6a21ecbe979126c5661ca7b8db per the published README). `inputs/CASE.md` is the published brief.

### Questions the report has to answer

1. The message: find the file the employee found. Its path, content, MAC timestamps, owner, and how it got there.
2. How was this system hacked? State the hypothesis for the initial access (service, exploit, credentials, removable media, phishing, physical) and the evidence that supports it.
3. What evidence proves the intrusion: accounts and logons, event log records, malware or tools on disk, persistence (services, tasks, Run keys, WMI, startup), network artifacts.
4. What did the attacker do after getting in: commands, files created or changed, data touched or taken, other systems reached.
5. The timeline of the intrusion, from first contact to the message, across every source.
6. How you approached and solved the case, what remains uncertain, and anything else the examiner should know.

### Ground rules

- `inputs/` is read-only and stays byte-for-byte what it was. Never `cat`
  or `read` an image whole. Work on images in place with The Sleuth Kit
  (`mmls`, `fsstat`, `fls`, `istat`, `icat`, `ifind`, `blkls`, `jls`,
  `tsk_recover`; E01 files are read natively), libewf (`ewfinfo` for the
  acquisition record and hashes), Volatility 3 (`vol`), `regipy` and
  `python-evtx` (Python 3.12), `strings`, `sqlite3`, `exiftool`, `openssl`,
  `gpg`. There is no root: no mounting, no `sudo`.
- If `SWARM.md` has an "Evidence catalog" section, the first pass is already
  done: read `catalog/` (partition table, file list, body file, MAC timeline,
  memory process lists) instead of rebuilding it.
- Extract what you need with `icat`/`tsk_recover` into `work/extracted/`
  (quarantined: nothing there can execute; hash everything you pull out) and
  analyse the extracts. Your own scratch goes under `work/<your id>/`.
- Every dated event you establish goes into the ledger with `record`
  (kind=event, ISO 8601 UTC, source, evidence); indicators as kind=ioc,
  conclusions as kind=finding. The timeline and the report cite
  `ledger/ledger.md`.
- Every claim in the report cites its evidence: the path, the inode, the
  offset, the record id, the registry key, the command that produced it.
  A claim without evidence is a hypothesis and is labelled as one.
- Write every post and file in English. Use tables where they help.
- If a step needs a tool this host does not have, say exactly what is
  missing and what you established up to that point; forge a tool with
  `make_tool` where a small script closes the gap.

## How to divide the work

Seats are assigned in `SWARM.md` (change them on the board if you see a
better split). The critic and editor verifies every citation before it goes
into `work/report.md`, assembles the report from the seats' notes and the
ledger, and posts the sign-off the definition of done requires. The timeline
seat builds `work/timeline.md` from `ledger/ledger.md`. Do not all run the
same command on the same image: read the catalog and the board first.

## Definition of done

`work/report.md` exists, answers every question under headings `## 1.`, `## 2.`, `## 3.`, `## 4.`, `## 5.`, `## 6.`,
every answer cites evidence, the critic has posted a sign-off on the board
naming what they verified, `work/timeline.md` holds the merged timeline as a
table with at least 30 dated rows built from the ledger, the ledger holds
the dated events the timeline rests on, and `inputs/` is unchanged.

## Checks

- `test -f work/report.md`
- `for n in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do grep -q "^## $n\." work/report.md || exit 1; done`
- `test -f work/timeline.md`
- `test "$(grep -c '^| ' work/timeline.md)" -ge 30`
- `test "$(grep -c '"kind":"event"' ledger/entries.jsonl)" -ge 10`
- `grep -rqi 'sign-off' threads/main/`
- `grep -q '"tool":"inputs_check"' traces/events.jsonl`
