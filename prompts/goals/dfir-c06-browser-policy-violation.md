## Goal

An internal investigation for HR: they believe an employee violates the acceptable use policy by using a web browser that does not comply with policy. The image was prepared to cover Windows and browser forensic artifacts.

The evidence is under `inputs/` (read-only; call `inputs` to list it):
`inputs/Browser_Policy_Violation.E01`, a 6.3 GB E01 image of the employee's Windows machine; `inputs/Browser_Policy_Violation.txt`, the acquisition record. `inputs/CASE.md` is the published brief.

### Questions the report has to answer

1. System and users: Windows edition, computer name, time zone, the user accounts and their activity windows.
2. Every browser present on the system (installed or portable), which user used it, first and last use, and how you know (program folders, prefetch, Amcache, ShimCache, UserAssist, LNK, profiles).
3. The non-compliant browser: what it is, where it came from (download record, USB, archive), when it arrived and was first run, and by whom.
4. What it was used for: history, searches, downloads, sessions, cookies and cache of interest, with times.
5. Attempts to hide or clean: private mode, deleted history, cleaning tools, renamed executables, and the traces they left anyway ($UsnJrnl, $LogFile, carving, shellbags).
6. The timeline of the violation.
7. Conclusion for HR: what the evidence establishes, with what confidence, and what it does not.

### Ground rules

- `inputs/` is read-only and stays byte-for-byte what it was. Never `cat`
  or `read` an image whole. Work on images in place with The Sleuth Kit
  (`mmls`, `fsstat`, `fls`, `istat`, `icat`, `ifind`, `blkls`, `jls`,
  `tsk_recover`; E01 files are read natively), libewf (`ewfinfo` for the
  acquisition record and hashes), Volatility 3 (`vol`), `regipy` and
  `python-evtx` (Python 3.12), `strings`, `sqlite3`, `exiftool`, `openssl`,
  `gpg`. There is no root: no mounting, no `sudo`.
- If `SWARM.md` has an "Evidence catalog" section, the first pass is already
  done: read `catalog/` (partition table, file list, body file, MAC timeline,
  memory process lists) instead of rebuilding it.
- Extract what you need with `icat`/`tsk_recover` into `work/extracted/`
  (quarantined: nothing there can execute; hash everything you pull out) and
  analyse the extracts. Your own scratch goes under `work/<your id>/`.
- Every dated event you establish goes into the ledger with `record`
  (kind=event, ISO 8601 UTC, source, evidence); indicators as kind=ioc,
  conclusions as kind=finding. The timeline and the report cite
  `ledger/ledger.md`.
- Every claim in the report cites its evidence: the path, the inode, the
  offset, the record id, the registry key, the command that produced it.
  A claim without evidence is a hypothesis and is labelled as one.
- Write every post and file in English. Use tables where they help.
- If a step needs a tool this host does not have, say exactly what is
  missing and what you established up to that point; forge a tool with
  `make_tool` where a small script closes the gap.

## How to divide the work

Nobody has been given a job. Read the goal and the evidence catalog, see on
the board what your peers have taken, decide what you are going to do, and
call `name(name, doing)` to say what to call you and what you are taking on. Fill what nobody has taken; if two of you want the same thing,
settle it in a post. Say so again when you change course.

Somebody has to keep the timeline from `ledger/ledger.md`, and somebody has to
assemble `work/report.md` from the answers in the ledger. Agree between you
who does, early, because the run is not finished until both exist. Do not all
run the same command on the same image: read the catalog and the board first.

**Report author and critic.** Two of you take these roles early with
`name(doing=…)`, and they are different agents. The report author writes the
answers from the ledger, not from memory: compact first, read `ledger`, then
one `record(kind=answer)` per question (`section=question:<n>`) and one each
for `summary` and `narrative`, citing `E-<seq>` for every claim and stating
the confidence and its reason, the contrary evidence, the limitations, what
else could explain it and what would change the answer. When the ledger cannot
answer, reopen the investigation and say so on the board. The critic
re-derives each finding an answer rests on from its sealed refs and records
`attest` (what was re-derived, what only read) or `dispute` (why), then does
the same for every answer. The critic writes no answer; the author attests
nothing of their own. The sign-off is these acts, not a post. Nothing else is
assigned.

## Definition of done

`work/report.md` exists, answers every question under headings `## 1.`,
`## 2.`, `## 3.`, `## 4.`, `## 5.`, `## 6.`, `## 7.`, every answer cites
evidence, the ledger holds one `answer` entry per question (`question:1` to
`question:7`) and one each for `summary` and `narrative`, with every defect
the answers check names fixed or named by a limitation, and the critic, who
wrote none of them, has recorded `attest` or `dispute` on each answer, saying
what they verified, `work/timeline.md` holds the merged timeline as a table
with at least 30 dated rows built from the ledger, the ledger holds the dated
events the timeline rests on, and `inputs/` is unchanged.

## Checks

- `test -f work/report.md`
- `for n in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; do grep -q "^## $n\." work/report.md || exit 1; done`
- `test -f work/timeline.md`
- `test "$(grep -c '^| ' work/timeline.md)" -ge 30`
- `test "$(grep -c '"kind":"event"' ledger/entries.jsonl)" -ge 10`
- `node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings "$SWARM_HARNESS/scripts/check-answers.ts" --sections 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,summary,narrative`
- `grep '"tool":"inputs_check"' traces/events.jsonl | tail -1 | grep -q '"content_ok":true'`
  (`inputs_check` is an event the harness writes itself when `done` verifies
  the inputs, before it runs these checks. Nobody needs to forge a tool for
  it, and `make_tool` will refuse that name.)
