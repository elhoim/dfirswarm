## Goal

The user downloaded what they thought was the SysInternals tool suite, double-clicked it, but the tools did not open. Since then the system has "slowed down" and become less responsive. The goal is to determine what happened, and when. (Case formed with help from Harlan Carvey.)

The evidence is under `inputs/` (read-only; call `inputs` to list it):
`inputs/SysInternalsCase.E01`, a 7.8 GB E01 image of the Windows machine; `inputs/SysInternalsCase.E01.txt`, the acquisition record. `inputs/CASE.md` is the published brief.

### Questions the report has to answer

1. What did the user download, from where and when? The browser record, the download path, the Zone.Identifier stream, the file's hash and size.
2. What was the file really? Its type and hashes, strings and indicators, what it dropped or extracted and where, and every registry, task, service or startup change tied to it.
3. How does it persist, and what does it do on the system? The cause of the slowdown, with evidence (processes in event logs, prefetch, scheduled tasks, services, WMI, injected components).
4. Network indicators: hosts, IPs, URLs, DNS names and ports in the artifacts, with where each was found.
5. The timeline of the infection, from the download to the last observed activity.
6. Indicators of compromise, the remediation steps, and anything else the examiner should know.

### Ground rules

- `inputs/` is read-only and stays byte-for-byte what it was. Never `cat`
  or `read` an image whole. Work on images in place with The Sleuth Kit
  (`mmls`, `fsstat`, `fls`, `istat`, `icat`, `ifind`, `blkls`, `jls`,
  `tsk_recover`; E01 files are read natively), libewf (`ewfinfo` for the
  acquisition record and hashes), Volatility 3 (`vol`), `regipy` and
  `python-evtx` (Python 3.12), `strings`, `sqlite3`, `exiftool`, `openssl`,
  `gpg`. There is no root: no mounting, no `sudo`.
- If `SWARM.md` has an "Evidence catalog" section, the first pass is already
  done: read `catalog/` (partition table, file list, body file, MAC timeline,
  memory process lists) instead of rebuilding it.
- Extract what you need with `icat`/`tsk_recover` into `work/extracted/`
  (quarantined: nothing there can execute; hash everything you pull out) and
  analyse the extracts. Your own scratch goes under `work/<your id>/`.
- Every dated event you establish goes into the ledger with `record`
  (kind=event, ISO 8601 UTC, source, evidence); indicators as kind=ioc,
  conclusions as kind=finding. The timeline and the report cite
  `ledger/ledger.md`.
- Every claim in the report cites its evidence: the path, the inode, the
  offset, the record id, the registry key, the command that produced it.
  A claim without evidence is a hypothesis and is labelled as one.
- Write every post and file in English. Use tables where they help.
- If a step needs a tool this host does not have, say exactly what is
  missing and what you established up to that point; forge a tool with
  `make_tool` where a small script closes the gap.

## How to divide the work

Seats are assigned in `SWARM.md` (change them on the board if you see a
better split). The critic and editor verifies every citation before it goes
into `work/report.md`, assembles the report from the seats' notes and the
ledger, and posts the sign-off the definition of done requires. The timeline
seat builds `work/timeline.md` from `ledger/ledger.md`. Do not all run the
same command on the same image: read the catalog and the board first.

## Definition of done

`work/report.md` exists, answers every question under headings `## 1.`, `## 2.`, `## 3.`, `## 4.`, `## 5.`, `## 6.`,
every answer cites evidence, the critic has posted a sign-off on the board
naming what they verified, `work/timeline.md` holds the merged timeline as a
table with at least 25 dated rows built from the ledger, the ledger holds
the dated events the timeline rests on, and `inputs/` is unchanged.

## Checks

- `test -f work/report.md`
- `for n in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do grep -q "^## $n\." work/report.md || exit 1; done`
- `test -f work/timeline.md`
- `test "$(grep -c '^| ' work/timeline.md)" -ge 25`
- `test "$(grep -c '"kind":"event"' ledger/entries.jsonl)" -ge 10`
- `grep -rqi 'sign-off' threads/main/`
- `grep -q '"tool":"inputs_check"' traces/events.jsonl`
